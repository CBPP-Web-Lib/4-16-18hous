      <p>The <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/policy-basics-the-housing-choice-voucher-program">Housing Choice Voucher Program</a>, the nation&rsquo;s largest <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/policy-basics-federal-rental-assistance">federal rental assistance</a> program, enables families to afford decent, stable housing, avoid homelessness, and make ends meet. This map allows users to examine where voucher-assisted households live in the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Neighborhoods are color-coded according to their poverty rate,<sup><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></sup> score on our opportunity index,<sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></sup> share of residents who are people of color,<sup><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></sup> and Home Owners&rsquo; Loan Corporation (HOLC) &ldquo;Residential Security&rdquo; maps<sup><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></sup> (only available for selected cities). For more, read our full report [LINK TO FULL PAPER].</p>

<p class="dots_note">Dots represent groups of households or housing units. They are randomly placed within each neighborhood and do not represent the precise locations of individual voucher-assisted households or voucher-affordable rental units.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Select a metro area, type of map, and type of voucher-assisted household using the drop-down menus.</li>
	<li>Add or remove voucher-assisted households and voucher-affordable<sup><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></sup> units using the checkboxes at the bottom of the map.</li>
	<li>Click on the expand button in the lower right to enable full screen view.</li>
</ul>
      <div class="figure-footnotes">
        <p><sup><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a></sup> High-poverty neighborhoods are Census tracts with poverty rates above 30 percent, while low-poverty neighborhoods are Census tracts with poverty rates under 10 percent.</p>
        
        <p><sup><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a></sup> Our opportunity index is a composite measure that considers school quality, poverty, labor market engagement, access to jobs, and access to transit. Low-opportunity neighborhoods are in the bottom 20 percent of all metropolitan Census tracts, while high-opportunity neighborhoods are in the top 20 percent. See our methodology [LINK to paper appendix 2] for more details.</p>
        
        <p><sup><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a></sup> Neighborhoods are color-coded as &ldquo;HUD-defined &lsquo;minority-concentrated&rsquo; neighborhood&rdquo; when the share of people that identify as a person of color is at least 20 percentage points higher than the share for the metro area as a whole. This is based on HUD&rsquo;s official measure of &ldquo;areas of minority concentration&rdquo; used in the Rental Assistance Demonstration program.</p>
        
        <p><sup><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a></sup> Also known as &ldquo;redlining&rdquo; maps, HOLC maps were color-coded based on the supposed lending risk of neighborhoods in major U.S. cities. In practice, these maps were largely drawn along racial and ethnic lines, helping codify patterns of racial and economic segregation that persist to this day. See National Community Reinvestment Coalition, &ldquo;How 1930s discrimination shaped inequality in today&rsquo;s cities,&rdquo; March 27, 2018, <a href="https://ncrc.org/how-1930s-discrimination-shaped-inequality-in-todays-cities/">https://ncrc.org/how-1930s-discrimination-shaped-inequality-in-todays-cities/</a>.</p>
        
        <p><sup><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a></sup> In this analysis, voucher-affordable rental units are those with gross rents below the local two-bedroom Small Area Fair Market Rent. For more details, read our full methodology here [LINK to paper appendix 2].</p> </div>
