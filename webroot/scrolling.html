        <h2>Families Using Housing Vouchers Live in Higher Poverty Neighborhoods Compared to Other Renters With Low Incomes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Families using vouchers are often concentrated in higher poverty neighborhoods, but to a lesser degree than renters assisted by public housing or project-based rental assistance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Black families make up nearly half of voucher-assisted families nationally (48%) and over two-thirds of voucher-assisted families living in Milwaukee (68%). (Source: 2022 HUD Picture of Subsidized Households)

        <h2>Voucher-Assisted Families of Color with Children are Particularly Locked Out of Low-Poverty Neighborhoods</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Families of color, and particularly assisted Black families with children, are concentrated in the higher poverty, predominantly Black neighborhoods of north Milwaukee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Growing up in high-poverty neighborhoods can have negative long-term effects on children, underscoring the need to invest resources in historically marginalized communities of color to mitigate poverty’s harm on children of color living in these neighborhoods.

        <h2>Extensive History of Racist Housing Policies Have Locked Many Families of Color Out of Low-Poverty Neighborhoods
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Families of color with children using housing vouchers in Milwaukee are half as likely to live in low-poverty neighborhoods compared to voucher-assisted households overall (8% vs. 17%), but roughly the same share of both groups live in high-poverty neighborhoods (33% vs. 32%).
          </li>
          <li>
            Milwaukee shows a much more dramatic racial disparity than we observe nationally: 22% of voucher-assisted households in the 100 largest metros live in low-poverty neighborhoods, compared to 21% of assisted families of color with children.
          </li>

        <h2>Renters of Color Concentrated into Racially Segregated
          and High-Poverty Neighborhoods Face Increased Eviction Risk          
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Evictions and eviction filings disproportionately impact Black mothers and their children, according to a major study that links eviction court records to ACS data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Growing up in a household that is filed against or evicted can have long-lasting negative consequences for children, including poor educational outcomes and increased risk of mental health issues.

        <h2>Gap Between VAUs and Voucher-Assisted Households Suggests Other Forces Beyond Personal Preference
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            SAFMRs in theory unlock lots of voucher-affordable rental units in lower poverty neighborhoods; However, many renters of color attempting to use their housing voucher run into source of income discrimination and administrative burdens imposed by the voucher program, both compounded by the racial discrimination many renters of color face in housing.
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s nothing wrong with assisted Black renters or other renters of color choosing to live in communities of color; the focus should be on providing housing options in the communities of their choice and trusting that they know which neighborhood is best for them. 
          </li>
          <li>
            But the concentration of VAUs in neighborhoods made up largely of affluent white people reflects explicitly racist housing policies that created deeply segregated neighborhoods that persist today.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='milwaukee-6'>
        <h2>Despite Concentration of Voucher-Assisted Families in Higher Poverty Neighborhoods, SAFMRs Broaden Housing Options in Low-Poverty Neighborhoods</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While only 11 percent of voucher-assisted families with children in Milwaukee live in low-poverty neighborhoods, over a third (34 percent) of VAUs are in low-poverty areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            Expanding housing options in lower poverty neighborhoods is particularly important for families of color with children, who have historically been excluded from living in these communities and therefore face additional barriers to accessing rental units in these neighborhoods.
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting payment standards at the ZIP code level instead of at the metro level also reduces the number of VAUs in high-poverty neighborhoods.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='milwaukee-7'>
        <h2>White Communities Effectively “Opportunity Hoard” by Excluding Voucher-Assisted People of Color</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It’s important to put current patterns of racial segregation in the context of the long history of racist housing policies like redlining, restrictive covenants, and outright violence against families of color attempting to move into predominantly white communities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The stark contrast between plentiful VAUs and the clear absence of families of color using their vouchers in these communities reflect the scars of racially discriminatory policies that limited their housing options and homeownership opportunities and exposed many to more predatory housing market conditions than white renters.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='madison-1'>
        <h2>Persistent Segregation Found in Larger Metros Typically Mirrored in Mid-Size Cities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Smaller cities such as Madison, while sometimes less racially diverse than larger metro areas like Milwaukee, often show similar patterns of segregation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Voucher-assisted families of color largely live in communities where Black and Latinx people make up a larger share of residents located on the far east and west side.
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s a notable absence of assisted families of color in the Madison’s more affluent communities of Shorewood Hills and Middleton, and the town of Monona.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='madison-2'>
        <h2>Wide Spread of Voucher-Affordable Units Suggests Voucher Program’s Promise in Desegregation Efforts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are voucher-affordable units in these communities, but more must be done to make sure assisted families, particularly families or color with children, can access these units if they choose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Desegregation efforts must balance expanding housing options in lower poverty neighborhoods, while respecting each families right to choose the best community for them and their children – including staying in a community that might be labelled as “low opportunity” by some measures.
          </li>
