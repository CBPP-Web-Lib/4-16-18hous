  <h2>Public Housing</h2>
  <h3>Washington, D.C.</h3>
  <p>
    Established in 1937, the Public Housing program is the nation’s oldest form of rental assistance. Early projects were usually segregated on the basis of race, a practice that was not officially outlawed until the 1960s.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Today, most of the 1.8 million Americans living in over 950,000 households assisted by public housing are located in neighborhoods with high rates of poverty.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Most public housing developments are over 40 years old and in dire need of investment and repair. Public housing properties are operated by a network of over 3,300 state and local public housing agencies.

          The Washington D.C. metro area’s deeply entrenched racial segregation reflects the lasting impact of racist housing policies intentionally designed to separate and isolate white and Black residents.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" name="dc-15">
      <p>
          Racially restrictive covenants, widely adopted in the city of DC in the early 1900s, legally prohibited people of color from buying or occupying homes in many white communities. Restrictive covenants were enforceable by courts until 1948, confining Black residents to certain parts of the city and allowing policymakers to not provide the same resources and investment as neighborhoods where only white residents were allowed to live.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Neighborhoods that used restrictive covenants reenforced racial segregation and helped depress Black homeownership rates in those neighborhoods to this day.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Washington D.C.’s public housing complexes were originally racially segregated, with separate developments built for white and Black residents, further contributing to residential segregation.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> By the time the developments were officially desegregated in the 1950s, much of the city had become highly segregated along intertwined lines of race and economic status, shaped by Jim Crow laws and New Deal-era federal housing policies. Created in the 1930s, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) provided mortgages to homeowners, guided by maps they color-coded by perceived lending risk. HOLC largely relied on a neighborhood’s racial demographics to determine creditworthiness, deeming communities of color as “hazardous,” a practice known as “redlining” for the red marking these communities in HOLC’s maps.
      </p>
      <p>
          While HOLC’s redlining maps institutionalized the idea that proximity to people of color increases lending risk and decreases property values, the GI Bill and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) cemented racially discriminatory lending practices in the following decades.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> The GI Bill helped white veterans purchase homes by providing low-interest mortgages but excluded Black veterans from receiving the same benefits. The FHA adopted a discriminatory rating system similar to HOLC that systematically excluded communities of color from the same homeownership opportunities afforded to white communities. The FHA only insured home loans almost exclusively in white communities, helping spur an exodus of white residents to the surrounding suburbs in the DC metro area.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Between 1950 and 1970, over half (60 percent) of the white residents moved out of the city of DC.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> These changes were also reflected in public housing: Black residents became the overwhelming majority of public housing residents, as it remains today. While Black people currently make up 24 percent of the D.C. metro area’s overall population, 92 percent of households living in D.C.’s public housing are headed by a Black person.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Nationally, Black people make up 12 percent of the overall population, while 42 percent of all households living in public housing are headed by a Black person.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='dc-2'>
        <p>
          Today, most Black residents in the DC metro area live in low-poverty neighborhoods. However, Black DC renters are impacted by past racist housing policies leading to higher rates of housing insecurity and significant overrepresentation in high-poverty neighborhoods. Households headed by a Black person make up two-thirds (67 percent) of all renter households in high-poverty neighborhoods in the DC metro area, compared to 13 percent of households headed by a white person and households headed by a Latine person.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Much of the public housing stock in the DC metro area is in these higher poverty neighborhoods, confining many assisted families in areas of concentrated poverty. For example, only 2 percent of people in the DC metro area live in high-poverty neighborhoods yet a third (33 percent) of Black families with children assisted by public housing live in high-poverty neighborhoods. Living in high-poverty neighborhoods can negatively impact access to jobs, transportation costs to work, and access to fresh and reasonably priced food and other basic goods and services.
      </p>
      <p>
          However, the problem isn’t with the public housing program itself. Housing agencies could create housing options in lower poverty neighborhoods and state and local policymakers could invest resources to improve neighborhoods so that living in a high poverty neighborhood doesn’t mean poor schools, lack of resources, and other hardships. Public housing does good for families and individuals with low incomes, helping prevent displacement as housing costs rise and enabling them to continue living in the DC metro area as affordable housing options dwindle in the private market. Many public housing residents also develop a sense of community with other residents, building important social ties they rely on for support and safety.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> These connections can also serve as a foundation for tenant organizing efforts that help public housing residents hold housing agencies accountable and leverage their lived expertise to improve living conditions.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='dc-3'>
        <p>
          Families and individuals in the DC metro area living in public housing are much more concentrated in higher poverty neighborhoods relative to other rental assistance programs. Some 28 percent of households assisted by public housing live in high-poverty neighborhoods, compared to 13 percent of PBRA-assisted households and 9 percent of voucher-assisted households. (See Fig. X). Public housing residents are also less likely to live in low-poverty neighborhoods relative to PBRA-assisted households and voucher-assisted households in the DC metro area.
      </p>
      <p>
          Most metro areas show a similar concentration of public housing units in high-poverty areas. Public housing residents in two-thirds of the 100 most populous metros are more likely to live in high-poverty neighborhoods compared to voucher and PBRA-assisted households.
      </p>
      <p>
          While it can be difficult for renters with a housing voucher to find a landlord to rent to them, a much higher share are able to rent units in moderate and low-poverty neighborhoods of their choosing. Because public housing is so concentrated in the DC metro area, residents who rely on it do not have the same choice about where they get to live. This is especially significant given the long history of housing policies that have limited where Black and other people of color can live. Given that over 90 percent of households living in D.C.’s public housing are headed by a Black person, this is deeply unjust.

          Despite its shortcomings, public housing remains a critical source of permanently affordable housing, particularly in the Northeast and Puerto Rico. But insufficient funding creates long wait times to secure a unit; a group of residents admitted to D.C. Housing Authority (DCHA) public housing in 2022 spent an average of <em>nearly 16 years </em>on the waiting list before receiving assistance.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Nationally, public housing residents waited an average of 20 months before receiving assistance in 2023.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Demand for public housing far outstrips supply: DCHA’s public housing assists roughly 5,350 households<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>, yet over 24,000 households are still on DCHA’s waiting list for public housing, as of 2023.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Despite high demand, a recent HUD report found DCHA has the lowest public housing occupancy rate of any large housing agency, with over 1 in 5 units currently vacant.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> (See Fig. X). Limited funding and poor management have left many of these vacant units dilapidated due to neglect, in some cases posing significant health and safety hazards.
      </p>
      <p>
          During their inspection of vacant public housing units, HUD found multiple units with mold and moss growing on the walls and floors from active leaks. In 2019, DCHA reported that the vast majority of its units need significant capital improvements, such as new heating and cooling systems, roofs, and plumbing, requiring an estimated $2.2 <em>billion</em> to address.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>

    <h2>Project-Based Rental Assistance</h2>
    <h3>Los Angeles</h3>
    <p>
      The Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance Program (PBRA) was established in 1974. Project-based assistance means the rental subsidy is tied to a unit in a building. The tenant will receive assistance as long as they occupy the unit. It is administered by private owners who enter into rental assistance agreements with HUD. Most owners are for-profit entities, but nonprofits and some public housing agencies own a significant share of Section 8 PBRA properties. By the mid-1980s, the program faced criticism for rising costs and concentrating assisted families in neighborhoods with high poverty rates.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Although Congress stopped funding new PBRA contracts in 1983, the program still helps house roughly 2 million people in 1.2 million households.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
  </p>
  <img style="width:580px" src="demo_assets/image11.png" />

      <p>
        The Los Angeles metro area is home to the largest Latine population, second largest Asian population, and fourth largest Native Hawai’ian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) population of any metro area in the U.S. It also has one of the highest rent cost burden rates of any metro area: 56 percent of renter households spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent each month, and nearly a third (31 percent) pay more than half their income on rent.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> California has long dealt with an acute housing affordability and homelessness crisis, driven by a deep shortage of housing affordable to renters with the lowest incomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every 100 renter households in the Los Angeles metro area with extremely low incomes,<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> there are only 21 affordable and available rental units.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> This makes housing insecurity all but inevitable for renters with the lowest incomes who do not receive rental assistance. Even California’s higher state minimum wage is not enough to cover the high cost of housing. A full-time employee working at the $16 an hour minimum wage would have to work 96 hours each week just to afford a modest one-bedroom rental unit in California.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class='slide' name='la-2'>
      <p>
        Such severe housing affordability issues make the Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance Program (PBRA) a crucial source of affordable housing for over 39,000 families with low incomes living in the Los Angeles metro area. Asian and NHPI renters are most likely to be assisted by PBRA compared to other race/ethnicity groups in the metro area. Asian and NHPI people make up 17 percent of the Los Angeles metro area’s overall population, but 32 percent of PBRA-assisted households are headed by an Asian or NHPI person, a significantly higher share than voucher-assisted households and public housing residents.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is partly driven by PBRA-funded properties located in neighborhoods where Asian and NHPI renters make up the overwhelming majority of residents. These neighborhoods also tend to have high rates of poverty: One-fourth of PBRA-assisted households headed by an Asian or NHPI person live in high-poverty neighborhoods, a slightly higher share than the one-fifth of all PBRA-assisted families in the Los Angeles metro area living in high-poverty neighborhoods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over half (53 percent) of renter households headed by an Asian person in the Los Angeles metro area are cost-burdened, and nearly 1 in 3 (30 percent) pay more than 50 percent of their income on rent each month.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> Despite many Asian renters facing high housing costs, Asian renters are still less likely to be burdened by housing costs than Black and Latine renters both nationally and in the Los Angeles metro area. However, Asian and NHPI renters with low incomes are more likely to be living in overcrowded housing. Among renters with low incomes living in cost-burdened households, Asian and NHPI renters have a higher likelihood of living with extended family in doubled-up and overcrowded households than most race/ethnicity groups.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Asian and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander renters often face distinct housing challenges that aren’t always captured when the two groups are combined, which typically happens for statistical purposes. For instance, while Asian people experience the lowest rate of homelessness, NHPI people have the highest homelessness rate of any race/ethnicity group.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> This partly reflects the intergenerational impact of settler colonialism and displacement on NHPI communities in Hawai’i and U.S. Territories in the Pacific and the high share of NHPI residents living in expensive housing markets.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> This has shaped their unique experiences of homelessness and housing insecurity, which are distinct from those of indigenous people in the contiguous United States.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> A higher share of NHPI people live below the poverty line, and NHPI renters are more likely to be burdened by housing costs and live in an overcrowded household compared to Asian renters.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide" name="la-3">
      <p>
        Older adults make up the overwhelming majority of those assisted by PBRA in the Los Angeles metro area: over 3 in 4 (77%) PBRA-assisted households are headed by a person aged 62 and older, a much higher share than voucher-assisted households and public housing residents.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> (See Fig. X). While this aligns with national demographics of PBRA-assisted households, it’s a significantly higher share than the roughly half (53 percent) of PBRA-assisted households headed by older adults overall.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This reflects in part properties providing housing to older adults through the Housing for the Elderly program (also known as Section 202) that are still subsidized through the PBRA program.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> Section 202 housing typically includes service coordinators who help connect residents with other community services that support independent living, including physical and behavioral health services for those who want and need them. PBRA is a critical funding source for affordable housing for older adults, helping provide financing to preserve existing properties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rental assistance helps communities create a variety of integrated housing options for older adults – including supportive housing – so that people can choose the housing that meets their needs without being isolated from the rest of the community. This includes scattered-site supportive housing, including for households with tenant-based vouchers, and project-based supportive housing that houses a mix of people who do and don’t need supportive services. This can help older adults who want to age in place live in their own homes instead of congregate care settings, such as nursing homes or psychiatric facilities.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Older adults and non-elderly people with disabilities are much more likely to receive federal rental assistance than other people in need of assistance, but there are still many people in these groups who face serious hardship because they can’t afford housing.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> A recent representative study of adults experiencing homelessness in California found that 44 percent of unhoused adults were 50 and older.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> Many older adults are no longer able to work and rely on fixed incomes provided by Supplemental Security Income (SSI) that are often too low to cover housing costs.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> In 2023, over 4,700 people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles City and County Continuum of Care (CoC) were 65 and older, of which nearly three-fourths (74 percent) were experiencing unsheltered homelessness.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> Living in a car, on the street, or other places not meant for human habitation, can exacerbate risk of chronic disease and serious mental illness, lower access to health services, and increase food insecurity for older adults.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide" name="la-4">
      <p>
        PBRA assists roughly 6,500 households that include a person with a disability in the Los Angeles metro area. Some 14 percent of PBRA-assisted households including a person with a disability live in high-poverty neighborhoods in the Los Angeles metro area. Rental assistance can help people with disabilities whose only source of income is SSI keep a roof over their head. For instance, SSI in California provides a basic monthly benefit of $1,163 in 2024, which is too little to pay for a typical one-bedroom apartment even if they use every dollar of their benefits for rent.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, funding limitations leave many renters with disabilities and low incomes without the assistance they need to stay stably housed. While some may require supportive housing, rental assistance and short-term support in navigating the rental market are likely enough for most adults with disabilities to gain long-term housing stability.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Renters with disabilities and low incomes also face unique barriers to housing affordability and accessibility. Finding a unit that accommodates the needs of people with disabilities so they can easily enter and safely use it can be challenging due to the dearth of accessible homes. Even when a home is accessible, people with disabilities often face landlord discrimination: discrimination based on disability accounted for over half of fair housing complaints filed nationally in 2022.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> People with disabilities are also often excluded from employment and education opportunities, and people with disabilities can face higher cost of living due to steep medical bills, transportation, and expensive home accessibility modifications.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, people with disabilities are more likely to live below the federal poverty line, live in poor quality housing, and experience homelessness compared to people without disabilities, posing additional challenges to housing security.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> Lack of sufficient income or rental assistance to stay stably housed can force people with disabilities into congregate or institutional settings that undermine their independence. Expanding access to inclusive and affordable housing means people with disabilities can live in neighborhoods that best meet their needs, such as near key community resources, services, or social supports that reduce isolation and barriers to community living.

  <h2>Housing Choice Vouchers</h2>
  <h3>Milwaukee</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Congress authorized the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program in 1974. Today it is the largest form of federal rental assistance, assisting roughly 5 million people in 2.3 million households.<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> Housing vouchers are tenant-based assistance, meaning the voucher is issued to an individual or family to use in the private rental market. A voucher recipient must find a unit that meets the program’s quality standards and has a landlord willing to participate. A family with a voucher generally must contribute the higher of 30 percent of its income or a “minimum rent” of up to $50 for rent and utilities. The voucher covers the rest of those costs, up to a limit (called a payment standard) set by the housing agency that is based on HUD’s fair market rent estimates. If a family moves, they can take their voucher with them, provided the new unit and landlord are eligible and willing to participate in the program. The HCV program is administered by a network of nearly 2,200 state and local public housing agencies.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55"><sup>[55]</sup></a>
</p>
<section name="milwaukee">
  <div class="slide" name="milwaukee-1">
    <p>
      The Milwaukee metro area is home to nearly 1.6 million people, 64 percent of whom are white, 16 percent are Black, 12 percent are Latine, and 4 percent are Asian. Milwaukee is one of the most racially segregated metro areas in the country, reflecting the past and present impact of racist and exclusionary housing policies.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>
  </p>
  <p>
      Starting in the early 1900s, policies such as redlining and restrictive covenants excluded people of color from homeownership opportunities and barred them from living in more affluent, predominantly white neighborhoods. By the 1940s, nearly all of the suburbs surrounding the city of Milwaukee used restrictive covenants to exclude Black people from owning or occupying homes.<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> Families of color had far less choice about where they could live and were largely relegated to areas of Milwaukee that did not receive the same resources and investment afforded to white communities.<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>
  </p>
  <p>
      Policies like redlining continue to have lasting impacts on Milwaukee residents today. People living in historically redlined neighborhoods in Milwaukee County (which includes the city of Milwaukee) are more likely to be in poverty and identify as Black or Latine.<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> Residents of historically redlined neighborhoods in Milwaukee County also continue to experience lending discrimination, marked by lower lending rates and higher costs for those who do receive loans.<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>
  </p>
  <p>
      The intersecting impact of racial and economic segregation has produced staggering racial inequities in concentrated poverty and access to lower poverty neighborhoods. Black people make up just 16 percent of residents in the Milwaukee metro area but over half (53 percent) of people living in high-poverty neighborhoods and only 3 percent of people living in low-poverty neighborhoods. Latine people, who make up just 12 percent of the Milwaukee metro’s population, make up 23 percent of residents in high-poverty neighborhoods and only 6 percent of residents in low-poverty neighborhoods.
  </p>
  <p>
      Black Milwaukee families are also more likely to face housing insecurity compared to other race/ethnicity groups: over half (53 percent) of renter households headed by a Black person are cost burdened in the Milwaukee metro area compared to 44 percent of renter households headed by a white or Latine person.<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> Black renters are more likely to receive rental assistance due to higher need stemming from the past and present impact of systemic racism.<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> Over two-thirds (69 percent) of voucher-assisted households in the Milwaukee metro area are headed by a Black person, reflecting this outsized need.<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63"><sup>[63]</sup></a>
  </p>

  </div>
  <div class="slide" name="milwaukee-2">
    <p>
      There are roughly 9,400 households using a housing voucher in the Milwaukee metro area. In theory these families and individuals should be able to use their vouchers in the neighborhood of their choice. For example, they are substantially more likely to live in lower poverty neighborhoods than residents of public housing or Project-Based Rental Assistance. But voucher holders’ housing options are significantly influenced by landlords’ willingness to accept housing vouchers. The share of voucher-affordable units – units whose rents are low enough to be covered by the voucher subsidy – in lower poverty neighborhoods is significantly higher than the share of voucher-assisted households. Over a third (34 percent) of voucher-affordable units are in low-poverty neighborhoods – double the share of voucher-assisted families living in low-poverty neighborhoods. Due to data limitations, we cannot identify which voucher-affordable units are vacant and their bedroom size. Voucher holders may be concentrated in higher poverty areas because of a mismatch in the types of units available (since studio and 1-bedroom units may be affordable with a voucher but too small for many families with children). Nonetheless, landlord discrimination is a key reason why so few voucher recipients use their vouchers in low-poverty neighborhoods.
  </p>
  <p>
      Landlords are significantly more likely to refuse to rent to someone with a voucher in low-poverty neighborhoods, which can limit housing options for voucher-assisted families in these neighborhoods.<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> Landlords may view required unit inspections as burdensome and not worth the additional time and effort, especially in neighborhoods where there is competition for units, making it are easier to opt for unassisted tenants. Some landlords stop accepting vouchers after negative experiences with inspections or because they did not feel adequately supported by the housing agency when a conflict arose with tenants.<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> Improving administration of inspections, creating funding for landlords to make minor repairs or accommodations to units, and providing stronger outreach to landlords can help address these types of concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
      But in some cases, landlords deny vouchers for more outright discriminatory reasons, including falsely believing that voucher-assisted families will not be good tenants or using status as a voucher holder as a proxy to discriminate against people based on race (since in many places most voucher holders are people of color). Source of Income (SOI) protections are designed to prevent discrimination against voucher-assisted families, but these laws are specific to states or localities and are sometimes poorly enforced. There are no specific federal protections against source of income discrimination. Milwaukee County enacted SOI protections in 2018, but the law has not prevented landlords from explicitly rejecting vouchers, with some still explicitly saying that they do not accept vouchers in published apartment listings. A recent investigation found many voucher-assisted families were completely unaware of the protections, and five years after enactment, there has not been a verified complaint of voucher discrimination.<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" name="milwaukee-3">
    <p>
      Families who use vouchers in the Milwaukee metro area are notably more likely to rent in higher poverty neighborhoods. Nearly a third (32 percent) of voucher-assisted families in the Milwaukee metro area live in high-poverty neighborhoods while only 17 percent live in low-poverty neighborhoods. This trend is even more pronounced for project-based vouchers: Almost half (49 percent) of families using project-based vouchers in the Milwaukee metro area live in high-poverty neighborhoods, compared to 28 percent of households using tenant-based vouchers.
  </p>

      When an individual or family is issued a voucher, they may have as little as 60 days to find a unit and landlord that will take the voucher, although housing agencies are free to set longer limits and provide extensions if needed. If a voucher holder does not succeed within the allowed time frame, they will have to return the voucher to the housing agency. Because many families wait months or even years before receiving a voucher, they are under intense pressure to find housing within the time limit. Some families do not even look for units in low-poverty neighborhoods because they anticipate that landlords will turn them down.<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> This fear is not unfounded, as landlords are significantly more likely to refuse to rent to someone with a voucher in low-poverty neighborhoods.<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68"><sup>[68]</sup></a>
  </p>
  <p>
      Not finding a unit and losing their voucher is a serious risk for many families that can vary widely by housing agency, in part because some agencies do a better job of providing search assistance to participants or avoiding inspection delays and other administrative problems that can play a major role in discouraging landlords from accepting vouchers. Less than half (44 percent) of families assisted by the Milwaukee City housing agency were successfully able to use their voucher in 2019, while 95 percent of families assisted by the Milwaukee County housing agency successfully used their voucher.<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> In communities where the housing agency doesn’t provide much help finding a unit, voucher-assisted families often rely on online listings specifically focused on voucher-friendly properties that are often concentrated in higher poverty neighborhoods.
  </p>
  <p>
      Aiding voucher-assisted families with high-touch search assistance and covering expenses like security deposits and screening fees significantly improves their ability to lease a unit in low-poverty neighborhoods.<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> This suggests that more families would like to use their voucher in a low-poverty neighborhood, but most housing agencies do not offer the services and supports needed to help families act on those preferences. Using vouchers to move to lower poverty neighborhoods can improve the mental and physical well-being of adults as well as long-term earnings and educational outcomes for children.<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>
  </p>
  <p>
      Some families may wish to use their vouchers to stay in communities with higher poverty rates, for example, to remain close to friends and family in their social support network, to public transportation that is often lacking in further flung suburbs, or to have a more manageable commute to work. Previous experiences with racism can also deter voucher-assisted families of color from searching or moving to a predominantly affluent and white community, as they may rightly anticipate that the community will be unwelcoming.<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> This underscores the need for reparative policies that address historic disinvestment and reduce poverty that helps all families in these communities.

      While all voucher-assisted households may face discrimination from landlords that do not wish to participate in the voucher program, families and individuals of color can face additional landlord discrimination because of their race or ethnicity. The compounding effect of both voucher and racial discrimination may explain why so few families and individuals of color can use their vouchers in low-poverty neighborhoods. In the Milwaukee metro, only 7 percent of Black households and 16 percent of Latine households with a voucher live in low-poverty neighborhoods. Meanwhile, 46 percent of white Milwaukee households use their vouchers in low-poverty neighborhoods. (See Fig. X).

  <p>
      Severe racial disparities partly reflect the racial discrimination Black and Latine people continue to face in the rental market.<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> People of color are often steered toward racially segregated neighborhoods with higher poverty rates during housing searches by landlords and realtors, reproducing patterns of racial and economic segregation.<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> Voucher recipients may not even realize their housing choices are being constrained because they do not know that the landlord is not showing them all available properties.
  </p>
  <p>
      Voucher-assisted families with children may also face additional housing discrimination from landlords, receiving differential treatment due to anticipated issues children may cause, such as overcrowding and more wear and tear on units.<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> One study found that while families with children are as likely as those without children to obtain an appointment for an available rental unit, they are shown fewer units and are told about slightly larger units that were more expensive to rent.<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> Discrimination can also have intersecting impacts across race/ethnicity, gender, and presence of children. For example, limited evidence suggests Black and Latina women are penalized during housing searches for being parents and for being single mothers, while white women are not.<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>

<h2>Policy Recommendations</h2>
<p>
  Federal, state, and local policymakers should seek to ensure that all people with low incomes can afford stable, good-quality housing, that they can freely decide to stay in their current neighborhood or move to another location of their choice, and that wherever they live they have access to the community resources and amenities they need to thrive. We’re far short of those goals today, but there are many steps that policymakers could take to advance us closer to them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Expand rental assistance toward the goal of making it available to everyone who needs it</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The most important way to ensure that people have access to decent, stable, affordable housing is to expand rental assistance and ultimately make it available to every low-income person who needs it. Rental assistance is highly effective at reducing homelessness, overcrowding, and housing instability, but only reaches one in four eligible households due to funding limitations. Policymakers should also take other steps to make housing more affordable, such as increasing subsidies for affordable housing development, reforming zoning rules to allow more subsidized and market-rate housing to be built, and instituting well-designed rent regulations where appropriate. But these measures generally won’t make housing affordable to households with incomes around or below the poverty line unless the households also have rental assistance, so expanding rental assistance should be the single highest priority.<a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Improve rental assistance to make it more responsive to the needs and choices of participants</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Other actions will be needed to give people greater choice about where they live. One important approach is to make it easier for people to use tenant-based rental assistance in a wide range of neighborhoods.<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> Policymakers should fund housing navigators and other search assistance<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> and ensure that voucher holders have adequate time to look for housing before their vouchers expire. Other key changes would make it easier for families with vouchers to compete with higher-income applicants for available units, including by allowing voucher subsidies to be used for security deposits, ensuring that vouchers subsidies cover typical rents even in higher-cost neighborhoods by extending use of zip code-level Small Area Fair Market Rents,<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> and streamlining inspection requirements to avoid unnecessary delays.
</p>
<p>
  Along with these adjustments to the existing voucher program, it would be valuable to test a more fundamental change: provision of rental assistance directly to tenants rather than through owners. Direct rental assistance could reduce administrative burdens for families, agencies, and owners, and potentially broaden choice for participants. HUD called for local pilots to test direct rental assistance in a September 2023 statement that has already prompted emerging efforts around the country, and a federally funded demonstration could evaluate the approach on a large enough scale to determine whether it should be adopted more broadly.<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>
