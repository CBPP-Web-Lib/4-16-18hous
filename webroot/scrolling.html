  <h2>Public Housing</h2>
  <h3>Washington, D.C.</h3>
  <p>
    Established in 1937, the Public Housing program is the nation’s oldest form of rental assistance. Early projects were usually segregated on the basis of race, a practice that was not officially outlawed until the 1960s.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Today, most of the 1.8 million Americans living in over 950,000 households assisted by public housing are located in neighborhoods with high rates of poverty.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Most public housing developments are over 40 years old and in dire need of investment and repair. Public housing properties are operated by a network of over 3,300 state and local public housing agencies.

          The Washington D.C. metro area’s deeply entrenched racial segregation reflects the lasting impact of racist housing policies intentionally designed to separate and isolate white and Black residents.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" name="dc-15">
      <p>
          Racially restrictive covenants, widely adopted in the city of DC in the early 1900s, legally prohibited people of color from buying or occupying homes in many white communities. Restrictive covenants were enforceable by courts until 1948, confining Black residents to certain parts of the city and allowing policymakers to not provide the same resources and investment as neighborhoods where only white residents were allowed to live.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Neighborhoods that used restrictive covenants reenforced racial segregation and helped depress Black homeownership rates in those neighborhoods to this day.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Washington D.C.’s public housing complexes were originally racially segregated, with separate developments built for white and Black residents, further contributing to residential segregation.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> By the time the developments were officially desegregated in the 1950s, much of the city had become highly segregated along intertwined lines of race and economic status, shaped by Jim Crow laws and New Deal-era federal housing policies. Created in the 1930s, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) provided mortgages to homeowners, guided by maps they color-coded by perceived lending risk. HOLC largely relied on a neighborhood’s racial demographics to determine creditworthiness, deeming communities of color as “hazardous,” a practice known as “redlining” for the red marking these communities in HOLC’s maps.
      </p>
      <p>
          While HOLC’s redlining maps institutionalized the idea that proximity to people of color increases lending risk and decreases property values, the GI Bill and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) cemented racially discriminatory lending practices in the following decades.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> The GI Bill helped white veterans purchase homes by providing low-interest mortgages but excluded Black veterans from receiving the same benefits. The FHA adopted a discriminatory rating system similar to HOLC that systematically excluded communities of color from the same homeownership opportunities afforded to white communities. The FHA only insured home loans almost exclusively in white communities, helping spur an exodus of white residents to the surrounding suburbs in the DC metro area.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Between 1950 and 1970, over half (60 percent) of the white residents moved out of the city of DC.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> These changes were also reflected in public housing: Black residents became the overwhelming majority of public housing residents, as it remains today. While Black people currently make up 24 percent of the D.C. metro area’s overall population, 92 percent of households living in D.C.’s public housing are headed by a Black person.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Nationally, Black people make up 12 percent of the overall population, while 42 percent of all households living in public housing are headed by a Black person.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='dc-2'>
        <p>
          Today, most Black residents in the DC metro area live in low-poverty neighborhoods. However, Black DC renters are impacted by past racist housing policies leading to higher rates of housing insecurity and significant overrepresentation in high-poverty neighborhoods. Households headed by a Black person make up two-thirds (67 percent) of all renter households in high-poverty neighborhoods in the DC metro area, compared to 13 percent of households headed by a white person and households headed by a Latine person.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Much of the public housing stock in the DC metro area is in these higher poverty neighborhoods, confining many assisted families in areas of concentrated poverty. For example, only 2 percent of people in the DC metro area live in high-poverty neighborhoods yet a third (33 percent) of Black families with children assisted by public housing live in high-poverty neighborhoods. Living in high-poverty neighborhoods can negatively impact access to jobs, transportation costs to work, and access to fresh and reasonably priced food and other basic goods and services.
      </p>
      <p>
          However, the problem isn’t with the public housing program itself. Housing agencies could create housing options in lower poverty neighborhoods and state and local policymakers could invest resources to improve neighborhoods so that living in a high poverty neighborhood doesn’t mean poor schools, lack of resources, and other hardships. Public housing does good for families and individuals with low incomes, helping prevent displacement as housing costs rise and enabling them to continue living in the DC metro area as affordable housing options dwindle in the private market. Many public housing residents also develop a sense of community with other residents, building important social ties they rely on for support and safety.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> These connections can also serve as a foundation for tenant organizing efforts that help public housing residents hold housing agencies accountable and leverage their lived expertise to improve living conditions.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='dc-3'>
        <p>
          Families and individuals in the DC metro area living in public housing are much more concentrated in higher poverty neighborhoods relative to other rental assistance programs. Some 28 percent of households assisted by public housing live in high-poverty neighborhoods, compared to 13 percent of PBRA-assisted households and 9 percent of voucher-assisted households. (See Fig. X). Public housing residents are also less likely to live in low-poverty neighborhoods relative to PBRA-assisted households and voucher-assisted households in the DC metro area.
      </p>
      <p>
          Most metro areas show a similar concentration of public housing units in high-poverty areas. Public housing residents in two-thirds of the 100 most populous metros are more likely to live in high-poverty neighborhoods compared to voucher and PBRA-assisted households.
      </p>
      <p>
          While it can be difficult for renters with a housing voucher to find a landlord to rent to them, a much higher share are able to rent units in moderate and low-poverty neighborhoods of their choosing. Because public housing is so concentrated in the DC metro area, residents who rely on it do not have the same choice about where they get to live. This is especially significant given the long history of housing policies that have limited where Black and other people of color can live. Given that over 90 percent of households living in D.C.’s public housing are headed by a Black person, this is deeply unjust.

          Despite its shortcomings, public housing remains a critical source of permanently affordable housing, particularly in the Northeast and Puerto Rico. But insufficient funding creates long wait times to secure a unit; a group of residents admitted to D.C. Housing Authority (DCHA) public housing in 2022 spent an average of <em>nearly 16 years </em>on the waiting list before receiving assistance.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Nationally, public housing residents waited an average of 20 months before receiving assistance in 2023.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Demand for public housing far outstrips supply: DCHA’s public housing assists roughly 5,350 households<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>, yet over 24,000 households are still on DCHA’s waiting list for public housing, as of 2023.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Despite high demand, a recent HUD report found DCHA has the lowest public housing occupancy rate of any large housing agency, with over 1 in 5 units currently vacant.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> (See Fig. X). Limited funding and poor management have left many of these vacant units dilapidated due to neglect, in some cases posing significant health and safety hazards.
      </p>
      <p>
          During their inspection of vacant public housing units, HUD found multiple units with mold and moss growing on the walls and floors from active leaks. In 2019, DCHA reported that the vast majority of its units need significant capital improvements, such as new heating and cooling systems, roofs, and plumbing, requiring an estimated $2.2 <em>billion</em> to address.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>

    <h2>Project-Based Rental Assistance</h2>
    <h3>Los Angeles</h3>
    <p>
      The Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance Program (PBRA) was established in 1974. Project-based assistance means the rental subsidy is tied to a unit in a building. The tenant will receive assistance as long as they occupy the unit. It is administered by private owners who enter into rental assistance agreements with HUD. Most owners are for-profit entities, but nonprofits and some public housing agencies own a significant share of Section 8 PBRA properties. By the mid-1980s, the program faced criticism for rising costs and concentrating assisted families in neighborhoods with high poverty rates.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Although Congress stopped funding new PBRA contracts in 1983, the program still helps house roughly 2 million people in 1.2 million households.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>

        <h2>Gap Between VAUs and Voucher-Assisted Households Suggests Other Forces Beyond Personal Preference
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            SAFMRs in theory unlock lots of voucher-affordable rental units in lower poverty neighborhoods; However, many renters of color attempting to use their housing voucher run into source of income discrimination and administrative burdens imposed by the voucher program, both compounded by the racial discrimination many renters of color face in housing.
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s nothing wrong with assisted Black renters or other renters of color choosing to live in communities of color; the focus should be on providing housing options in the communities of their choice and trusting that they know which neighborhood is best for them. 
          </li>
          <li>
            But the concentration of VAUs in neighborhoods made up largely of affluent white people reflects explicitly racist housing policies that created deeply segregated neighborhoods that persist today.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='milwaukee-6'>
        <h2>Despite Concentration of Voucher-Assisted Families in Higher Poverty Neighborhoods, SAFMRs Broaden Housing Options in Low-Poverty Neighborhoods</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While only 11 percent of voucher-assisted families with children in Milwaukee live in low-poverty neighborhoods, over a third (34 percent) of VAUs are in low-poverty areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            Expanding housing options in lower poverty neighborhoods is particularly important for families of color with children, who have historically been excluded from living in these communities and therefore face additional barriers to accessing rental units in these neighborhoods.
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting payment standards at the ZIP code level instead of at the metro level also reduces the number of VAUs in high-poverty neighborhoods.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>White Communities Effectively “Opportunity Hoard” by Excluding Voucher-Assisted People of Color</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It’s important to put current patterns of racial segregation in the context of the long history of racist housing policies like redlining, restrictive covenants, and outright violence against families of color attempting to move into predominantly white communities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The stark contrast between plentiful VAUs and the clear absence of families of color using their vouchers in these communities reflect the scars of racially discriminatory policies that limited their housing options and homeownership opportunities and exposed many to more predatory housing market conditions than white renters.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class='slide' name='madison-1'>
        <h2>Persistent Segregation Found in Larger Metros Typically Mirrored in Mid-Size Cities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Smaller cities such as Madison, while sometimes less racially diverse than larger metro areas like Milwaukee, often show similar patterns of segregation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Voucher-assisted families of color largely live in communities where Black and Latinx people make up a larger share of residents located on the far east and west side.
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s a notable absence of assisted families of color in the Madison’s more affluent communities of Shorewood Hills and Middleton, and the town of Monona.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='madison-2'>
        <h2>Wide Spread of Voucher-Affordable Units Suggests Voucher Program’s Promise in Desegregation Efforts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are voucher-affordable units in these communities, but more must be done to make sure assisted families, particularly families or color with children, can access these units if they choose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Desegregation efforts must balance expanding housing options in lower poverty neighborhoods, while respecting each families right to choose the best community for them and their children – including staying in a community that might be labelled as “low opportunity” by some measures.
