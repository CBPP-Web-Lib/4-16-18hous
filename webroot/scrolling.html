  <h2>Public Housing</h2>
  <h3>Washington, D.C.</h3>
  <p>
    Established in 1937, the Public Housing program is the nation’s oldest form of rental assistance. Early projects were usually segregated on the basis of race, a practice that was not officially outlawed until the 1960s.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Today, most of the 1.8 million Americans living in over 950,000 households assisted by public housing are located in neighborhoods with high rates of poverty.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Most public housing developments are over 40 years old and in dire need of investment and repair. Public housing properties are operated by a network of over 3,300 state and local public housing agencies.

          The Washington D.C. metro area’s deeply entrenched racial segregation reflects the lasting impact of racist housing policies intentionally designed to separate and isolate white and Black residents.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" name="dc-15">
      <p>
          Racially restrictive covenants, widely adopted in the city of DC in the early 1900s, legally prohibited people of color from buying or occupying homes in many white communities. Restrictive covenants were enforceable by courts until 1948, confining Black residents to certain parts of the city and allowing policymakers to not provide the same resources and investment as neighborhoods where only white residents were allowed to live.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Neighborhoods that used restrictive covenants reenforced racial segregation and helped depress Black homeownership rates in those neighborhoods to this day.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Washington D.C.’s public housing complexes were originally racially segregated, with separate developments built for white and Black residents, further contributing to residential segregation.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> By the time the developments were officially desegregated in the 1950s, much of the city had become highly segregated along intertwined lines of race and economic status, shaped by Jim Crow laws and New Deal-era federal housing policies. Created in the 1930s, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) provided mortgages to homeowners, guided by maps they color-coded by perceived lending risk. HOLC largely relied on a neighborhood’s racial demographics to determine creditworthiness, deeming communities of color as “hazardous,” a practice known as “redlining” for the red marking these communities in HOLC’s maps.
      </p>
      <p>
          While HOLC’s redlining maps institutionalized the idea that proximity to people of color increases lending risk and decreases property values, the GI Bill and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) cemented racially discriminatory lending practices in the following decades.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> The GI Bill helped white veterans purchase homes by providing low-interest mortgages but excluded Black veterans from receiving the same benefits. The FHA adopted a discriminatory rating system similar to HOLC that systematically excluded communities of color from the same homeownership opportunities afforded to white communities. The FHA only insured home loans almost exclusively in white communities, helping spur an exodus of white residents to the surrounding suburbs in the DC metro area.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Between 1950 and 1970, over half (60 percent) of the white residents moved out of the city of DC.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> These changes were also reflected in public housing: Black residents became the overwhelming majority of public housing residents, as it remains today. While Black people currently make up 24 percent of the D.C. metro area’s overall population, 92 percent of households living in D.C.’s public housing are headed by a Black person.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Nationally, Black people make up 12 percent of the overall population, while 42 percent of all households living in public housing are headed by a Black person.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='dc-2'>
        <p>
          Today, most Black residents in the DC metro area live in low-poverty neighborhoods. However, Black DC renters are impacted by past racist housing policies leading to higher rates of housing insecurity and significant overrepresentation in high-poverty neighborhoods. Households headed by a Black person make up two-thirds (67 percent) of all renter households in high-poverty neighborhoods in the DC metro area, compared to 13 percent of households headed by a white person and households headed by a Latine person.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Much of the public housing stock in the DC metro area is in these higher poverty neighborhoods, confining many assisted families in areas of concentrated poverty. For example, only 2 percent of people in the DC metro area live in high-poverty neighborhoods yet a third (33 percent) of Black families with children assisted by public housing live in high-poverty neighborhoods. Living in high-poverty neighborhoods can negatively impact access to jobs, transportation costs to work, and access to fresh and reasonably priced food and other basic goods and services.
      </p>
      <p>
          However, the problem isn’t with the public housing program itself. Housing agencies could create housing options in lower poverty neighborhoods and state and local policymakers could invest resources to improve neighborhoods so that living in a high poverty neighborhood doesn’t mean poor schools, lack of resources, and other hardships. Public housing does good for families and individuals with low incomes, helping prevent displacement as housing costs rise and enabling them to continue living in the DC metro area as affordable housing options dwindle in the private market. Many public housing residents also develop a sense of community with other residents, building important social ties they rely on for support and safety.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> These connections can also serve as a foundation for tenant organizing efforts that help public housing residents hold housing agencies accountable and leverage their lived expertise to improve living conditions.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='dc-3'>
        <p>
          Families and individuals in the DC metro area living in public housing are much more concentrated in higher poverty neighborhoods relative to other rental assistance programs. Some 28 percent of households assisted by public housing live in high-poverty neighborhoods, compared to 13 percent of PBRA-assisted households and 9 percent of voucher-assisted households. (See Fig. X). Public housing residents are also less likely to live in low-poverty neighborhoods relative to PBRA-assisted households and voucher-assisted households in the DC metro area.
      </p>
      <p>
          Most metro areas show a similar concentration of public housing units in high-poverty areas. Public housing residents in two-thirds of the 100 most populous metros are more likely to live in high-poverty neighborhoods compared to voucher and PBRA-assisted households.
      </p>
      <p>
          While it can be difficult for renters with a housing voucher to find a landlord to rent to them, a much higher share are able to rent units in moderate and low-poverty neighborhoods of their choosing. Because public housing is so concentrated in the DC metro area, residents who rely on it do not have the same choice about where they get to live. This is especially significant given the long history of housing policies that have limited where Black and other people of color can live. Given that over 90 percent of households living in D.C.’s public housing are headed by a Black person, this is deeply unjust.
      </p>

        <p>
          Despite its shortcomings, public housing remains a critical source of permanently affordable housing, particularly in the Northeast and Puerto Rico. But insufficient funding creates long wait times to secure a unit; a group of residents admitted to D.C. Housing Authority (DCHA) public housing in 2022 spent an average of <em>nearly 16 years </em>on the waiting list before receiving assistance.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Nationally, public housing residents waited an average of 20 months before receiving assistance in 2023.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Demand for public housing far outstrips supply: DCHA’s public housing assists roughly 5,350 households<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>, yet over 24,000 households are still on DCHA’s waiting list for public housing, as of 2023.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Despite high demand, a recent HUD report found DCHA has the lowest public housing occupancy rate of any large housing agency, with over 1 in 5 units currently vacant.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> (See Fig. X). Limited funding and poor management have left many of these vacant units dilapidated due to neglect, in some cases posing significant health and safety hazards.
      </p>
      <p>
          During their inspection of vacant public housing units, HUD found multiple units with mold and moss growing on the walls and floors from active leaks. In 2019, DCHA reported that the vast majority of its units need significant capital improvements, such as new heating and cooling systems, roofs, and plumbing, requiring an estimated $2.2 <em>billion</em> to address.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>

    <h2>Project-Based Rental Assistance</h2>
    <h3>Los Angeles</h3>
    <p>
      The Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance Program (PBRA) was established in 1974. Project-based assistance means the rental subsidy is tied to a unit in a building. The tenant will receive assistance as long as they occupy the unit. It is administered by private owners who enter into rental assistance agreements with HUD. Most owners are for-profit entities, but nonprofits and some public housing agencies own a significant share of Section 8 PBRA properties. By the mid-1980s, the program faced criticism for rising costs and concentrating assisted families in neighborhoods with high poverty rates.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Although Congress stopped funding new PBRA contracts in 1983, the program still helps house roughly 2 million people in 1.2 million households.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>

        <p>
          The Los Angeles metro area is home to the largest Latine population, second largest Asian population, and fourth largest Native Hawai’ian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) population of any metro area in the U.S. It also has one of the highest rent cost burden rates of any metro area: 56 percent of renter households spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent each month, and nearly a third (31 percent) pay more than half their income on rent.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> California has long dealt with an acute housing affordability and homelessness crisis, driven by a deep shortage of housing affordable to renters with the lowest incomes.
      </p>
      <p>
          For every 100 renter households in the Los Angeles metro area with extremely low incomes,<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> there are only 21 affordable and available rental units.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> This makes housing insecurity all but inevitable for renters with the lowest incomes who do not receive rental assistance. Even California’s higher state minimum wage is not enough to cover the high cost of housing. A full-time employee working at the $16 an hour minimum wage would have to work 96 hours each week just to afford a modest one-bedroom rental unit in California.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class='slide' name='la-2'>
        <p>
          Such severe housing affordability issues make the Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance Program (PBRA) a crucial source of affordable housing for over 39,000 families with low incomes living in the Los Angeles metro area. Asian and NHPI renters are most likely to be assisted by PBRA compared to other race/ethnicity groups in the metro area. Asian and NHPI people make up 17 percent of the Los Angeles metro area’s overall population, but 32 percent of PBRA-assisted households are headed by an Asian or NHPI person, a significantly higher share than voucher-assisted households and public housing residents.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          This is partly driven by PBRA-funded properties located in neighborhoods where Asian and NHPI renters make up the overwhelming majority of residents. These neighborhoods also tend to have high rates of poverty: One-fourth of PBRA-assisted households headed by an Asian or NHPI person live in high-poverty neighborhoods, a slightly higher share than the one-fifth of all PBRA-assisted families in the Los Angeles metro area living in high-poverty neighborhoods.
      </p>
      <p>
          Over half (53 percent) of renter households headed by an Asian person in the Los Angeles metro area are cost-burdened, and nearly 1 in 3 (30 percent) pay more than 50 percent of their income on rent each month.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> Despite many Asian renters facing high housing costs, Asian renters are still less likely to be burdened by housing costs than Black and Latine renters both nationally and in the Los Angeles metro area. However, Asian and NHPI renters with low incomes are more likely to be living in overcrowded housing. Among renters with low incomes living in cost-burdened households, Asian and NHPI renters have a higher likelihood of living with extended family in doubled-up and overcrowded households than most race/ethnicity groups.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Asian and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander renters often face distinct housing challenges that aren’t always captured when the two groups are combined, which typically happens for statistical purposes. For instance, while Asian people experience the lowest rate of homelessness, NHPI people have the highest homelessness rate of any race/ethnicity group.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> This partly reflects the intergenerational impact of settler colonialism and displacement on NHPI communities in Hawai’i and U.S. Territories in the Pacific and the high share of NHPI residents living in expensive housing markets.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> This has shaped their unique experiences of homelessness and housing insecurity, which are distinct from those of indigenous people in the contiguous United States.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> A higher share of NHPI people live below the poverty line, and NHPI renters are more likely to be burdened by housing costs and live in an overcrowded household compared to Asian renters.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" name="la-3">
        <p>
          Older adults make up the overwhelming majority of those assisted by PBRA in the Los Angeles metro area: over 3 in 4 (77%) PBRA-assisted households are headed by a person aged 62 and older, a much higher share than voucher-assisted households and public housing residents.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> (See Fig. X). While this aligns with national demographics of PBRA-assisted households, it’s a significantly higher share than the roughly half (53 percent) of PBRA-assisted households headed by older adults overall.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          This reflects in part properties providing housing to older adults through the Housing for the Elderly program (also known as Section 202) that are still subsidized through the PBRA program.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> Section 202 housing typically includes service coordinators who help connect residents with other community services that support independent living, including physical and behavioral health services for those who want and need them. PBRA is a critical funding source for affordable housing for older adults, helping provide financing to preserve existing properties.
      </p>
      <p>
          Rental assistance helps communities create a variety of integrated housing options for older adults – including supportive housing – so that people can choose the housing that meets their needs without being isolated from the rest of the community. This includes scattered-site supportive housing, including for households with tenant-based vouchers, and project-based supportive housing that houses a mix of people who do and don’t need supportive services. This can help older adults who want to age in place live in their own homes instead of congregate care settings, such as nursing homes or psychiatric facilities.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Older adults and non-elderly people with disabilities are much more likely to receive federal rental assistance than other people in need of assistance, but there are still many people in these groups who face serious hardship because they can’t afford housing.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> A recent representative study of adults experiencing homelessness in California found that 44 percent of unhoused adults were 50 and older.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> Many older adults are no longer able to work and rely on fixed incomes provided by Supplemental Security Income (SSI) that are often too low to cover housing costs.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> In 2023, over 4,700 people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles City and County Continuum of Care (CoC) were 65 and older, of which nearly three-fourths (74 percent) were experiencing unsheltered homelessness.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> Living in a car, on the street, or other places not meant for human habitation, can exacerbate risk of chronic disease and serious mental illness, lower access to health services, and increase food insecurity for older adults.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide" name="la-4">
        <p>
          PBRA assists roughly 6,500 households that include a person with a disability in the Los Angeles metro area. Some 14 percent of PBRA-assisted households including a person with a disability live in high-poverty neighborhoods in the Los Angeles metro area. Rental assistance can help people with disabilities whose only source of income is SSI keep a roof over their head. For instance, SSI in California provides a basic monthly benefit of $1,163 in 2024, which is too little to pay for a typical one-bedroom apartment even if they use every dollar of their benefits for rent.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          However, funding limitations leave many renters with disabilities and low incomes without the assistance they need to stay stably housed. While some may require supportive housing, rental assistance and short-term support in navigating the rental market are likely enough for most adults with disabilities to gain long-term housing stability.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Renters with disabilities and low incomes also face unique barriers to housing affordability and accessibility. Finding a unit that accommodates the needs of people with disabilities so they can easily enter and safely use it can be challenging due to the dearth of accessible homes. Even when a home is accessible, people with disabilities often face landlord discrimination: discrimination based on disability accounted for over half of fair housing complaints filed nationally in 2022.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> People with disabilities are also often excluded from employment and education opportunities, and people with disabilities can face higher cost of living due to steep medical bills, transportation, and expensive home accessibility modifications.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
      </p>
      <p>
          As a result, people with disabilities are more likely to live below the federal poverty line, live in poor quality housing, and experience homelessness compared to people without disabilities, posing additional challenges to housing security.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> Lack of sufficient income or rental assistance to stay stably housed can force people with disabilities into congregate or institutional settings that undermine their independence. Expanding access to inclusive and affordable housing means people with disabilities can live in neighborhoods that best meet their needs, such as near key community resources, services, or social supports that reduce isolation and barriers to community living.

        <h2>White Communities Effectively “Opportunity Hoard” by Excluding Voucher-Assisted People of Color</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It’s important to put current patterns of racial segregation in the context of the long history of racist housing policies like redlining, restrictive covenants, and outright violence against families of color attempting to move into predominantly white communities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The stark contrast between plentiful VAUs and the clear absence of families of color using their vouchers in these communities reflect the scars of racially discriminatory policies that limited their housing options and homeownership opportunities and exposed many to more predatory housing market conditions than white renters.

        <h2>Persistent Segregation Found in Larger Metros Typically Mirrored in Mid-Size Cities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Smaller cities such as Madison, while sometimes less racially diverse than larger metro areas like Milwaukee, often show similar patterns of segregation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Voucher-assisted families of color largely live in communities where Black and Latinx people make up a larger share of residents located on the far east and west side.
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s a notable absence of assisted families of color in the Madison’s more affluent communities of Shorewood Hills and Middleton, and the town of Monona.

        <h2>Wide Spread of Voucher-Affordable Units Suggests Voucher Program’s Promise in Desegregation Efforts</h2>
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            Desegregation efforts must balance expanding housing options in lower poverty neighborhoods, while respecting each families right to choose the best community for them and their children – including staying in a community that might be labelled as “low opportunity” by some measures.
